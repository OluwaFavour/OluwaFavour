# Hi there 👋

This is the GitHub page for Favour Olusayo - and that's me 😁.
Find out all about me right here 👇

I'm a programmer that takes pleasure in solving challenging problems and want to share some of my most interesting findings here.
In my stack? Unfortunately, it is not that straightforward. Just about anything that catches my eye, even if it has nothing to do with technology, is something I will learn. I suppose I like encountering issues that need to be resolved. Let's put the babbling for another time, though. Here are the languages or technologies I use most often:

## My Main Stack

* Python
* Django
* C#
* ASP.NET
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Unity
* PHP

> In Addition

Making a living as a professional game designer is one of my life's goals. And someday, I will; I know it.
In my search for this particular golden chalice, though, I got sidetracked and ended up in the area of backend development, which is equally as lucrative. As for me, this is where I am right now. You may follow my day-to-day development and see examples of the projects I've created right here.

> More, but only a tiny bit.

I might have forgotten to say this, but I'm in my third year of studying Computer Science. As a result, I feel comfortable asserting that I have a solid grounding in essentials like Data Structures and Algorithms.

## The things I do while I'm not programming,

When I'm not slumped over my desk tapping away at the keys, I'm reading something creative, be it a book, webcomic, manga, novel, or anything else. I'm a gamer, kind of, and in my spare time I like a wide variety of activities, including physical working out, media consumption (anime, movies, etc.), creative expression, and musical enjoyment.
